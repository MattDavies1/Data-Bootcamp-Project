## Summary
Our group plans to study the relationship between alcohol and cannabis consumption across various indeces of health outcomes. These indeces may include; all-cause mortalitiy, intoxicated driving rates, crime rates, household median income, secondary school graudation, and hospitalisations. Ideally, we will collect this data for a 50 year period using largely open.canada.gov datasets.

## Questions

- Does alcohol or cannabis consumption correlate strongly to increases in crime as measured by number of crimes commited?
- Does increasing alcohol, and cannabis sales have a correlation to secondary school graudation rates?
- Does cannabis consuption trend with population level education rates?
- Is there a relationship between alcohol useage and cannabis usage?
- Does alcohol or cannabis usage have a correlation to rates of hospitalisations.
- Does median household income correlated with impaired driving?
