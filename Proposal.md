## Summary
Our group plans to study the relationship between alcohol and cannabis consumption across various indecies of health outcomes. These indecies may include; all-cause mortalitiy, intoxicated driving rates, crime rates, homelessness, household median income, consumption tax-rate, tobacco usage. Ideally, we will collect this data for a 50 year period using largely open.canada.gov datasets.

## Questions

- Does alcohol or cannabis consumption correlate strongly to increases in crime as measured by number of crimes commited?
- Is there a relationship between alcohol or cannabis and all-cause mortality? Which substance is a better predictor of ACM?
- Does cannabis consuption trend with population level education rates?
- Is there a relationship between alcohol useage and cannabis usage?
- Does alcohol or cannabis usage have a correlation to mental health outcomes (rates of depression, anxiety)
